28AlphasLaterQuest1,"Despair is dynamically affected by various different factors, including:\n\n1. Darkness. Too dark, and your Despair will increase dramatically. Torches, helmet lights and flashlights will mitigate this. Use these in conjunction with a campfire & bedroll for the best effect.\n\n2. Temperature. If you’re freezing or sweltering, your Despair will also increase dramatically. Find shelter!\n\n3. Environment: Varying degrees of wetness will change how Despair affects you, as will your shelter. If you’re warm, dry, sheltered, well lit or resting on a bed or bedroll, AND near an operating campfire, forge or chem station you can effectively treat Despair.\n\n4. Hunger and thirst affect how quickly your despair increases. Starvation/dehydration will drastically increase the rate at which you become affected by despair.\n\n5. Injuries will affect how quickly your despair increases, so treat them as quickly as you can!\n\n6. There is medication in trader stock and rare medical loot to treat your despair; St. John's Wort treats 10% and Lithium treats 25%.\n\n7. There is also lavender growing wild, which can be collected to make your own lavender seeds, and is also used to make Lavender Oil in a cooking pot at a campfire. Treats 3% Despair."
28AlphasLaterQuest10,"Weather effects are back. Temperature and wetness are effects that you'll need to manage effectively. Use insulated liners for when you're cold, and cooling mesh for when you're hot.\n\nNOTE: If you have biome progression enabled, you won't see any 'legacy' weather effects.\nDisable biome progression in your main menu settings to play with legacy weather."

28AlphasLaterQuest2,"8. All food has a positive effect. The better the food, the more effective the treatment.\n\n9. Killing zombies and animals will reduce your overall despair. Conversely, getting hit by enemies will increase it.\n\n10. Being in close proximity to zombies increases your Despair. The tougher the zombie, the worse the effect. The effect is compounded, so the more zombies there are, the worse it'll be.\n\n11. Player wellness. Your maximum health will also slow down the effects of despair. Every 10 additional health slows down the rate at which Despair affects you.\n\n12. The morale booster from the drone will slow down the rate at which despair affects you.\n\n13. The trader has an effect. Being close to a trader will slow down and/or reduce your Despair.\n\n14. The perk From the Shadows also has an effect on the way Despair affects you at NIGHT. The more points in the perk, the less Despair affects you at night.\n "

28AlphasLaterQuest3,"Bears and wolves are back in the forest.\n\nHazmat zombies are now immune to burning.\n\nNew Bunker Buster zombie. Only appears during bloodmoon(s), and can appear from the very first Bloodmoon. You’ll want to take it out quickly … think of it as a light demolition zombie.\n\nDemolition zombies appear at a much earlier gamestage.\n\nFrozen zombie variant. Slightly tougher, slightly slower, slightly more XP, and take slightly more damage than their Normal counterparts. Found in the snow biome.\n\nRotting zombie variant. They have lower HP, lower XP reward, and they take more damage. Found in the forest biome.\n\nCowboy zombie variant. Similar to normal zombies, these enemies are exclusive to the desert biome, identifiable by their cowboy hats.\n\nAll fatties (Big Mama, tourist etc.) explode when their health gets low, and are filled with a substance that’s irresistible to all zombies. If you are within range when they explode, they’ll cover you in this stuff - and attract other zombies. Cop and vulture vomit also has this effect.\n"

Some items require these tools to craft, and some have been moved from inventory crafting to workbench crafting.\n\nThe cement mixer now requires gasoline to work.\n\nThe ammo press is required to craft ammunition in a workbench.\n\nThe sawmill. Unlocked at the same level as the forge, use this workbench to craft wood logs into wood planks. Wrench a tablesaw for a sawblade, or purchase a sawblade from a trader.\n\nYou can combine duplicate items in the workbench to either repair or upgrade them, depending on their quality and durabilty.

28AlphasLaterQuest7,"All canned food found in loot, vending machines, and trader stock is uncooked. Cook it to make it safe to eat, or eat it and run the risk of food poisoning.\n\nUncooked cans don't replenish health, just food and water.\n\nWellness. Wellness is attached to your max health & stamina, and better foods or drinks will increase your wellness more. To keep increasing wellness, wait for a while between eating or drinking.\n\nFarming the terrain. You need a hoe to till the ground to plant seeds. Use the hoe with fertiliser in your inventory to upgrade the tilled ground. Fertilized terrain yields the same as a farmplot.\n\nFarm Plots require fertiliser and nails to craft, and are the same fertile level as fertilised ground.\n\nFertiliser is craftable in the cement mixer and chem station, and can be purchased from traders.\n\nAll plants can be picked up - press 'E' by default to pick them up.\n\nNew plant - lavender. Purple flower found growing in the Forest biome and in some POIs. Seeds are crafted from lavender flowers, no unlock required. Lavender flowers can be found in loot and trader stock, and Lavender seeds in trader stock."

DespairTip,"You are overwhelmed by how hopeless the situation appears. You can combat this by staying in a well-lit area, staying warm, and staying dry.\n\nProlonged periods of being wet, in darkness, or cold temperatures will increase the rate at which your despair grows.

questStartup_desc,"The idea behind this mod is to slow progression, make traders less powerful, and generally extend the time for a playthrough, while keeping the vanilla look and feel.\n\n[ffd700]GENERAL GAMEPLAY[-]\n\nPlayer starts with a new debuff - Despair.\n\nAs your despair increases, your abilities will be negatively affected. If despair reaches 100%, you'll be seconds from death.\nConversely, if you can manage your despair well, you'll receive buffs for remaining positive.\n\nThe despair indicator on the HUD will fill as your despair grows and will change colour to indicate the level of your despair.\n\nIf you're able to manage your despair and have a more positive outlook, the icon on the HUD will change, as will the fill colour to indicate your levels of positivity.\n\nDespair can also be checked from the player information screen.\n\nHeadshots! Zombies take maximum damage from headshots, however, they do take small damage if you miss the head.\n\nZombies DON'T bleed. Nothing undead takes bleed damage.\n\nThere are more zombies in the world. Biomes are gamestaged, which means zombies get tougher and their numbers increase as you level up.\n\nNights are dangerous, downtown is much more dangerous.\n\nTraders no longer offer quests, but they can be traded with.\n\nAll blades base damage rebalanced to adjust for damage over time lost from enemies not bleeding.\n "
